# 📝 Instacart Market Basket Analysis Documentation - Group 6
---

## 1. Project Overview

- **Dataset Used:**  
	*Instacart Market Basket Analysis* 

- **Goal of the Exercise:**  
  *The goal of the exercise is to develop a business question, Apply Normalization → Dimensional Modeling → Data Quality Dashboard using the Instacart Market Basket dataset.*  

- **Team Setup:**  
  - Standard Data Cleaning: *All members*
	- Addy: Departments
	- Aly:   Aisles
	- Angel: Orders
	- Nella: Products
	- Wish: Combination of prior and train
		
  - Data Quality (DQ) Checks:
	- Row Count comparison between raw and clean tables – Wish
	- Referential Integrity check – Wish
		
  - Data Modeling:
	- Create Fact and Dimension Tables based on the business question – Angel

  - Documentation: Aly and Nella 

- **Environment Setup:**  
  *Docker containers on a shared VM + local laptops.*
  - Ingestion: dlt
  - Modeling: dbt
  - Visualization: Metabase
  - Collaboration: Git + GitHub 

---

## 2. Architecture & Workflow

- **Pipeline Flow:**  
  ```
  raw → clean → mart → Metabase
  ```

- **Tools Used:**  
  - Ingestion: `dlt`  
  - Modeling: `dbt`  
  - Visualization: `Metabase`  

- **Medallion Architecture Application:**  

  - **Bronze (Raw):** *Initial ingestion of source data (Skipped)*  
  
  - **Silver (Clean):** 
	- Purpose: To provide a reliable, queryable "single source of truth" for major business entities.
		  
	- Key Activities:
		- Cleaning: We cast the appropriate columns needed and fix data quality issues.
		- Conforming: We standardize data types, apply consistent naming conventions, and ensure conformity across different sources.
		- Enriching: We join tables from different sources to create a more complete view.
		- State of the Data: Validated, cleaned, and organized by business concepts

  - **Gold (Mart):** *We build our star schemas (fact and dimension tables) in this layer.*

## 🧪 Running dbt Tests

### Clean (structural tests)

* Validate not-null constraints, accepted values, and row count consistency.
* Defined in: `models/clean/schema.yml`

**Run tests:**

```bash
docker compose --profile jobs run --rm \
  -w /workdir/transforms/instacart_grp6 \
  dbt test --profiles-dir . --target local
```

⚙️**Source Structure (Normalized):**  
The flow of data from data sources through a series of transformations into a mart schema:
  1. Data Sources:
    
	```
	
	- aisles.csv
    - departments.csv
    - order_products__prior.csv
	- order_products__train.csv
	- orders.csv
	- products.csv
	
	```
	
  2. Raw Schema:
  The raw data from each source is loaded into the raw schema:
	
	```
	
    - raw___insta_aisles
    - raw___insta_departments
    - raw___insta_order_products_prior
	- raw___insta_order_products_train
	- raw___insta_orders
	- raw___insta_products
	
	```
	
  3. Clean Schema:
  After cleaning and preprocessing, the data is transformed into the clean schema:

- stg_insta_aisles_grp6

	
```

	engine = "MergeTree()",
